Firearm Alarm
==============================

It can take as long as 5-7 minutes for a victim to respond for help in the event of a firearm discharge.

In this project, I aim to build an app that could help listen for firearms.
The intention is that when a firearm is detected, a notification may be sent to an emergency contact or a first responder.

The app was written in streamlit, and it can stream for live sound with the Sounddevice python library.
In the future, I would like to rewrite this in flask so that I can query the user's sound (through the user's web page) with MediaDevices.getUserMedia() in javascript.  

The model that I developed was a CNN.  It makes use of publicly available data from the environmental sound classification, and I acquired firearm sounds from multiple sources, such as youtube, urbansound8k, freesound, soundbible, mediafire, etc.
